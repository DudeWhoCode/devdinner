title: What is Dev Dinner Club?
---


Dev Dinner club is a group for anyone interested in a lively discussion about anything related to software development – over dinner!

Every month, we, the developers in local community meet up at a restaurant. In each dinner we will have a theme to discuss about, along with few experts on the table. After introductions and food orders, we kick each session off by discussing few intriguing questions related to the theme, but then let the conversation flow naturally. Come and join us for good conversation and good food – We are looking forward to meeting you soon!
